# The King's Last Stand

**A cooperative Warcraft III Definitive Edition defense RPG with a 40-wave campaign and endless crossover assaults.**

Players command distinct heroes and their own race-matched workers, buildings, and armies, build and upgrade four personal bases, and hold the King's Road against a changing undead and demonic invasion. King Aldric and his castle are the shared objective. The game combines hero progression and equipment with worker economy, construction, towers, boss fights, and personal boss rewards.

## Project status

Current development build: **KLS-D-8669a44192**.

- Map: `dist/KLS-D-8669a44192-Development.w3m`
- SHA-256: `b7d0b41039d0cd4d655daf97d40a0329d443f987c62e9a927c87a8fc7bb995a0`
- The install command could not replace the prior test map because World Editor currently holds `KLS-D-1a040d638c-Development.w3m` open. A verified archive copy of that older file exists under `backups/installed-diagnostics/`; install the current package after closing its editor session.
- Build manifest: dist/build-manifest.json

This package includes the Crownlands settlements, four-race companies, hero progression and custom content. Per-level +3 Strength, Agility, or Intelligence choices now appear as native hero ability plus buttons; the global stat-choice dialog is removed. The Undead Temple inherits the correct Temple parent, race building tooltips describe their actual roles, Undead Acolytes can haunt mines, and the Night Elf mine order can reach the starting mine. After the preserved 40-wave story, ten installed campaign crossover rosters repeat with live-wave scaling, a five-force wave 49 convergence, a Lady Vashj wave 50 boss, rotating campaign leaders and personal Legendary catalog rewards. King Aldric's death ends the run. Sacred Aura ranks 4/5 retain the generated 38.5%/27.5% and 42%/30% effects for both ability IDs. The source regression suite passes **105/105**; package readback and installed-editor API syntax pass.

This exact build still needs its own World Editor save/reopen, Test Map, Custom Game, gameplay, multiplayer and endurance checks, so it remains Development. The earlier user-reported Test Map success is a pass for `KLS-D-fd638ddcf5`. Use docs/ROADMAP-AND-ACCEPTANCE.md for current-build acceptance and docs/CROWNLANDS-EXPANSION.md for implementation details.

## Build and test

Use a Windows machine with Warcraft III: Reforged / Definitive Edition and its World Editor installed. A clean checkout must first prepare the API extractor prerequisites documented in docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md, then extract the API declarations and object tables from that installation. Do not copy another editor version's API tables into the project. The CascLib DLL/listfile bootstrap and configurable game path are known clean-checkout setup gaps; this snapshot does not claim to be a one-command bootstrap.

From the repository root, run:

    python -B tools/extract_game_api.py
    python -B tools/build_map.py
    python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v

To install the package-proven current development build into the local Custom Game test folder:

    python -B tools/build_map.py --install-test-map

Installation is local to that computer. Follow docs/PLAYER-GUIDE.md and docs/ROADMAP-AND-ACCEPTANCE.md for the exact human-run engine check.

## Repository contents

- source/ contains authoritative JASS runtime modules and the DE blank-map template.
- tools/ contains the deterministic map builder, data generators, packer, API extractor, and a licensed MPQ reader.
- tests/ contains focused regression tests.
- backups/Blank-DE.w3m is the pinned user-supplied blank starter map used by the builder.
- dist/ contains one current build-ID-named development map and its manifest. Replaced versions are archived locally under backups/development-builds/ and remain recoverable from Git history.

The user-installed API/object tables, generated builds, temporary test logs, old diagnostic maps, and compiled helper binaries are not checked in. A future builder extracts the required references from the installed game and records their provenance in the build manifest.
