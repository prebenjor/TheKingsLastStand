# The King's Last Stand

**A cooperative, 40-wave Warcraft III Definitive Edition defense RPG.**

Players command distinct heroes and their own race-matched workers, buildings, and armies, build and upgrade four personal bases, and hold the King's Road against a changing undead and demonic invasion. King Aldric and his castle are the shared objective. The game combines hero progression and equipment with worker economy, construction, towers, boss fights, and personal boss rewards.

## Project status

Current development build: **KLS-D-1a040d638c**.

- Map: `dist/KLS-D-1a040d638c-Development.w3m`
- SHA-256: `eaee0e501b3e7ced381bda7c93c530d79499faad94f2bb80304a9aeb1340e362`
- Installed test map: `C:\Users\asphy\Documents\Warcraft III\Maps\TheKingsLastStand\KLS-D-1a040d638c-Development.w3m` (hash matches).
- Build manifest: dist/build-manifest.json

This build expands the battlefield to 192×192 with four connected allied settlements; makes workers, build menus, structures and recruit roles match each selected hero's race; adds eight heroes, race-themed companies, level-up choices, a four-part optional story, and twenty race-themed rarity items with four Foundry recipes. Sacred Aura's rank 4/5 learned and learn-menu tooltips are generated from safe 38.5%/27.5% and 42%/30% effects for both ability IDs. The suite passes **87/87**; package readback and installed-editor API syntax pass. Previous versions are archived locally.

This exact build still needs its own World Editor save/reopen, Test Map, Custom Game, gameplay, multiplayer and 40-wave endurance checks, so it remains Development. The suite passes **88/88**. The earlier user-reported Test Map success is a pass for `KLS-D-fd638ddcf5`.

## Build and test

Use a Windows machine with Warcraft III: Reforged / Definitive Edition and its World Editor installed. A clean checkout must first prepare the API extractor prerequisites documented in docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md, then extract the API declarations and object tables from that installation. Do not copy another editor version's API tables into the project. The CascLib DLL/listfile bootstrap and configurable game path are known clean-checkout setup gaps; this snapshot does not claim to be a one-command bootstrap.

From the repository root, run:

    python -B tools/extract_game_api.py
    python -B tools/build_map.py
    python -B -m unittest discover -s tests -v

To install the package-proven current development build into the local Custom Game test folder:

    python -B tools/build_map.py --install-test-map

Installation is local to that computer. Follow docs/PLAYER-GUIDE.md and docs/ROADMAP-AND-ACCEPTANCE.md for the exact human-run engine check.

## Repository contents

- source/ contains authoritative JASS runtime modules and the DE blank-map template.
- tools/ contains the deterministic map builder, data generators, packer, API extractor, and a licensed MPQ reader.
- tests/ contains focused regression tests.
- backups/Blank-DE.w3m is the pinned user-supplied blank starter map used by the builder.
- dist/ contains one current build-ID-named development map and its manifest. Replaced versions are archived locally under backups/development-builds/ and remain recoverable from Git history.

The user-installed API/object tables, generated builds, temporary test logs, old diagnostic maps, and compiled helper binaries are not checked in. A future builder extracts the required references from the installed game and records their provenance in the build manifest.
